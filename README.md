## 5. Rationale

Text goes here

```
Describe the John Hopkins Evidenced-Based Practice Model used to improve your process or practice change—how the model guides you through the process. Broadly explain the main aspects or concepts of the model and how it aligns with your project, identifying the problem/gap/improvement needed, appraising & synthesizing evidence to develop the intervention (s), why you will use the rapid cycle of changes during implementation, and why the intervention(s) are expected to work (sustainability).

```

## 7. Context

Text goes here

```
Describe where the project will take place. 
Describe the setting of the project area (rural/urban), the location (clinic, school, hospital), the population (patients, nurses, other clinical staff, NPs, PAs, physicians, parents), the size of the population, or other items important to know before describing your intervention.  
Consider how your project may impact health equity; does it address certain social determinants of health (SDoH) or vulnerable/underserved populations, etc.
Describe the leadership (nursing, physician). 
Describe whether or not other initiatives that are closely related to or potentially competing with (or supporting) your project are taking place. 

```

## 8. Interventions

Text goes here

```
Describe your project in enough detail for someone to reproduce it. 
Describe the composition of the team/stakeholders doing the work; think of those helping to pull data/arrange meetings/maybe a director/project sponsor/etc. 
Consider breaking down your study into phase one and describe what happened, then phase two, etc.  

```

## 9. Study of the Interventions

Text goes here

```
How are you evaluating your uptake of the improvement/practice change? This is your primary metric(s) to assess the changes frequently and make rapid cycle changes. For example, “data is collected frequently (every week or so) to track so rapid cycle changes can be made.” Make sure to describe frequent communication with key stakeholders after implementation.
What other methods are being used to evaluate the project? (survey, chart review, discussion/interview—pre, during, and post)
Evidenced-Based Quality Improvement is a flexible process, so you need to describe it. Describe how you will communicate with your team for buy-in, addressing ongoing changes as you implement the project. 
Describe your participant demographics and the time you will spend with them, such as weekly, as the project is implemented. 
Describe the steps you are going to take to evaluate your project. 
Describe the expected outcomes.  

```

## 10. Measures

Text goes here

```
What surveys/instruments/questionnaires did you use?  Include surveys developed in the Appendices. 
Describe the data collection surveys/instruments/questionnaires:  (a) how many items there are; (b) if there are sub‐scales, what their names are and how many items are in each; (c) the scoring format (e.g., True/False, Likert scale, adjectival rating scale, numerical scale); (d) the number of response alternatives; (e) whether any items are reverse‐scored; (f) in cases of numerical sub‐scales, their ranges; and (g) how the scale as a whole is scored.
How are you going to measure the processes used in the project? 
Feasibility, Usability, and satisfaction are associated with the clinician's or EBQI team improvement process/practice change/results of a needs assessment.  
Feasibility- Did the project provide sufficient value to address the problem? Is the project viable and likely to succeed? Are there resources to support the continuation of the project? Do the benefits outweigh the cost/risk? Is there an intent to continue to use this project in the future? 
Usability- How useable is the intervention/project? Describe the facilitators and barriers of the project. What is the success rate? Whether users can perform the intervention, the time the intervention may take to complete and the completion rate, the error rate?  If they did not complete the intervention, how much did they complete?  What measures are you using to signal that the intervention is not working?  How will you measure if data collection tools are fully/partially filled out (missing data) or if everyone used the same pre/post-test –duplicate data? Are there steps in place to determine if data are entered correctly?  
Satisfaction- were the users satisfied with the intervention, or did they still recommend changes?  If you developed a survey to assess satisfaction- how did you verify it (e.g., content experts, clinicians, families?  Did you conduct stakeholder interviews to address the satisfaction of the project or intervention?

## 11. Analysis

Text goes here

```
How did you interpret your results?  
Quantitative: what statistical methods did you use to look at your data? Descriptive (e.g., Number and percent; mean and standard deviation).
If you sampled the same participants, pre-test and post-test (Paired sample), use a parametric t-test (samples > 20) or for non-parametric (samples < 20) use Wilcoxon signed rank test or for Likert Scales (1-5 response categories). For paired samples with Yes/No questions then use the McNemar test. For non-paired samples, use independent t-test or Mann-Whitney (non-parametric)
Qualitative data: Open-ended questions: “An analysis of the summarized information was conducted on the open-ended survey questions. The words were read word for word and categorized, organized, and summarized”. 
Discussion groups /Feedback/Interviews- “Notes were taken from the meeting, and a content analysis was conducted by analyzing the notes line by line to develop common categories and sub-categories. These categories were organized and summarized to inform the common themes from the meeting.”

## 12. Ethical Considerations

Text goes here

```
What ethical considerations were considered when designing this project, if any? What IRB (organization) reviewed this? What was the IRB determination: non-human subjects’ research, exempt from human subjects, exempt due to being a QI project or program evaluation as approved by the IRB? Were there any conflicts of interest?
```

## 13. Results

Describe how your projects are or are not similar to other studies. Describe whether your findings align with or contradict other projects or both. 
Describe how this project addresses the project's impact on people and systems. Describe the impact the project had on the target population.  If your project addressed health equity concerns, social determinants of health, and the vulnerable/underserved, describe how this project impacted or will impact these variables.
Describe the time it took to complete the project and if the participants were receptive. 
Describe the project's feasibility and usability and whether people were satisfied. 
Describe any reasons for any difference between observed and anticipated outcomes. Describe the reasons for this discrepancy.

Describe any intervention changes that should be added or deleted because of the costs/compromises or tradeoffs. 

```

## 16. Limitations

Text goes here

```
Describe the limitations to your project by addressing how your data, collection process, or other factors may be specific to your clinic, population, etc. 
Describe if your findings can be generalized to a larger population or if the findings are more local and specific. 
Describe the problems in the project design, methods, measurement, or analysis that limit the generalizability.
