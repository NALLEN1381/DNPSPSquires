Description of the approach to the ongoing assessment of contextual elements that contributed to the success, failure, efficiency, and cost. Methods employed for assessing completeness and accuracy of data
Course-Specific Criteria: What surveys/instruments/questionnaires did you use?  Include surveys developed in the Appendices. 
Describe the data collection surveys/instruments/questionnaires:  (a) how many items there are; (b) if there are sub‐scales, what their names are and how many items are in each; (c) the scoring format (e.g., True/False, Likert scale, adjectival rating scale, numerical scale); (d) the number of response alternatives; (e) whether any items are reverse‐scored; (f) in cases of numerical sub‐scales, their ranges; and (g) how the scale as a whole is scored. How are you going to measure the processes used in the project? 
Feasibility, Usability, and satisfaction are associated with the clinician's or EBQI team improvement process/practice change/results of a needs assessment.  
Feasibility- Did the project provide sufficient value to address the problem? Is the project viable and likely to succeed? Are there resources to support the continuation of the project? Do the benefits outweigh the cost/risk? Is there an intent to continue to use this project in the future? 
Usability- How useable is the intervention/project? Describe the facilitators and barriers of the project. What is the success rate? Whether users can perform the intervention, the time the intervention may take to complete and the completion rate, the error rate?  If they did not complete the intervention, how much did they complete?  What measures are you using to signal that the intervention is not working?  How will you measure if data collection tools are fully/partially filled out (missing data) or if everyone used the same pre/post-test –duplicate data? Are there steps in place to determine if data are entered correctly?  Satisfaction- were the users satisfied with the intervention, or did they still recommend changes?  If you developed a survey to assess satisfaction- how did you verify it (e.g., content experts, clinicians, families?  Did you conduct stakeholder interviews to address the satisfaction of the project or intervention?

## 11. Analysis

Text goes here

```
How did you interpret your results?  
Quantitative: what statistical methods did you use to look at your data? Descriptive (e.g., Number and percent; mean and standard deviation).
If you sampled the same participants, pre-test and post-test (Paired sample), use a parametric t-test (samples > 20) or for non-parametric (samples < 20) use Wilcoxon signed rank test or for Likert Scales (1-5 response categories). For paired samples with Yes/No questions then use the McNemar test. For non-paired samples, use independent t-test or Mann-Whitney (non-parametric)
Qualitative data: Open-ended questions: “An analysis of the summarized information was conducted on the open-ended survey questions. The words were read word for word and categorized, organized, and summarized”. 
Discussion groups /Feedback/Interviews- “Notes were taken from the meeting, and a content analysis was conducted by analyzing the notes line by line to develop common categories and sub-categories. These categories were organized and summarized to inform the common themes from the meeting.”
